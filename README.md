# Star Classification Using Spectral Data

I developed a machine learning–based classification system to categorize stars using astronomical spectral data. The project involved end-to-end data preprocessing, including data cleaning, parallax filtering, feature engineering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and class balancing with SMOTE. Implemented and compared multiple supervised learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (RBF kernel).

I selected Random Forest as the final model due to its strong balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. The system achieved high classification performance across accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics. To enhance usability, the final model was deployed through an interactive Gradio-based GUI, enabling real-time star classification.
